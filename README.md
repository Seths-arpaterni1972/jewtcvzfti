OMG just walked out of Heart Eyes and my brain is like a snow globe someone just shook. Totally chaotic, glitter everywhere, can't see straight. The whole place smells like buttery apocalypse — sticky popcorn bits everywhere, my shoes are paperweights stuck to the floor. Head's still spinning, can’t even remember if I blinked for the last hour and half. 

There was this one scene — a sunset, right? But it felt like 𝘧𝘪𝘭𝘮makers squeezed the sun and only pure honey dribbled out. Everything was dripping gold. But then—then they slam you with that jarring car crash, and I swear my heart skip-skipped. Soundtrack was insane, a thunderstorm trapped in a speaker just punching you straight in the vibrate-center of your bones.

> Wish I could 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   and just live in it for a while. Melting into one of those soft-focus shots, where everything's hazy like morning breath on a window pane. Imagine. Mornings felt like they were wrapped in velvet while eating pancakes made of whispers.

Charlotte's character—a volcano always on the edge of eruption but just holding it there, in the molten suspence. Her eyes, man, like two deep wells, and you could just drop a thought in there and never hear the echo. She makes you question if love is like jazz music—chaotic but somehow perfectly it. Jake, on the other hand, he's like that pencil you find in between sofa cushions—all chewed up, but somehow still working. God, the tension between them is a circuit board just sparking wildly and I couldn’t get enough.

Midway through, I swear the theater's AC started roaring like a jet engine, drowning in an avalanche of white noise. Pictures were flashing across the screen like a strobe light, I was both there and lost, like maybe the story was dancing in between synapses. My aching back was protesting louder than the  's climax but I was so glued to my seat as if gravitational pull had a personal vendetta.

Oh, you'd said something about wanting to 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   too, right? Could I somehow 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   into my eyeballs and see it over and over? It was madness, delightful madness. Images sloshing around in my head, colliding and whispering all at once like bees in a jar.

Anyway, got this JavaScript thing opened and no idea how it got here, but it feels like my brain right now. Broken and mysterious and kind of weirdly beautiful:

```javascript
function heartEyes() { 
  var love = undefined; 
  while(emotions < infinity) { 
    dive(deeper); 
  } 
}
```
